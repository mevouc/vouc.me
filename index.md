### Bio

French. Software engineer, climber, spontaneously crazy and joyful. I am
interested in algorithmics, 3D engines, image processing, language
design and education.

When I am not coding, you can find me at the pub with good friends, or
at the top of a route in my local climbing gym.

### Equativ

I am currently holding a Backend Engineer position at
[Equativ](https://equativ.com), in Paris.

As part of the Programmatic MarketPlace and Addressability Backend team, my role is to
maintain our APIs and implement new features (often defined by the Open RTB
standard) to improve integration of our partners (i.e advertizers) needs. Our
backend tools are mainly developed in C\#/.Net.

### Bentley Systems

Before that, I was a Software Engineer at [Bentley
Systems](https://www.bentley.com), also in Paris.

During my first 2 years at Bentley, as a part of the on-boarding
program, I first was switching teams within Bentley every 6 months. I
worked in turns on reality modeling projects, 3D rendering softwares and
user interfaces, in C++, C\# and TypeScript.

I am now a permanent developer, part a the Visualization team. My daily
work consists of maintaining and improving [E-on
software](https://info.e-onsoftware.com) products, especially VUE, a
toolset for creating CG environments.

### Teaching assistant

At EPITA, in addition to my Multimedia and Development major and related
school projects, I was one of a team of 39 teaching assistants. We were
a group of 5th year students, teaching C++, Java and C to 3rd year
students. We were responsible for writing all the projects and
practicals they had to do and help them when they needed it.

### Talks and student organization

I have been president of the student organization
[GConfs](https://facebook.com/GConfs) during two years, whithin which I
gave several tech talks. All my talks are available in this [YouTube
playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeAJs-DEM6oJbTFxqUFEUVt4wi91LDgF7).

During 2 days in September 2017, I was responsible with other members of
my organization of the recording and streaming of 35 talks at
[EuroBSDcon 2017](https://2017.eurobsdcon.org). You can watch all of
them on [GConfs\' YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo31Bhg3nNkb6jJF8OjxK81-ssAk250oa).
